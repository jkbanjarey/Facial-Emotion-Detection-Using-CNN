# **Emotion Detection using VGG16** ðŸŽ­  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project implements an **Emotion Detection Model** using the **VGG16** architecture. The model is trained on an image dataset containing various facial expressions to classify emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral**, etc.  

---

## âœ¨ Features  
- ðŸ§  **Utilizes VGG16** - a pre-trained deep learning model for feature extraction.  
- ðŸ”„ **Transfer Learning** - enhances model accuracy with pre-trained weights.  
- ðŸ“¸ **Image Preprocessing & Augmentation** - improves generalization.  
- ðŸ“Š **Performance Evaluation** - tracks accuracy and loss metrics.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of **labeled images** representing different emotions. Each image is:  
âœ” **Resized** to **224x224 pixels**.  
âœ” **Normalized** for consistent pixel value distribution.  
âœ” **Augmented** to improve model robustness.
